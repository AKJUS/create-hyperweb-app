Set up a modern Cosmos app by running one command
## Overview

```
npx create-cosmos-app my-app
cd my-app
yarn && yarn dev
```

Or you can install in globally

```
npm install -g create-cosmos-app
```
### Get Started Immediately

You **don‚Äôt** need to install or configure tools like cosmjs, keplr, nextjs, webpack or Babel.<br>
They are preconfigured so that you can focus on the code.

Create a project, and you‚Äôre good to go.
## Creating an App

To create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:
### npm global (preferred method)

if you installed it globally, you can do one of two methods:

```sh
create-cosmos-app
```

or, which we prefer, we made an alias to `cca` which is much easier to type:

```sh
cca
```

### npx

```sh
npx create-cosmos-app my-app
```
### npm

```sh
npm init cosmos-app my-app
```
### Yarn

```sh
yarn create cosmos-app my-app
```

It will create a directory called `my-app` inside the current folder.
